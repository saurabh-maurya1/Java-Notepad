## Introduction

Core Java is the foundation of Java programming. It includes the basic concepts of the Java language, object-oriented programming, exception handling, and various APIs provided by Java Standard Edition (SE). This repository serves as a guide to mastering Core Java concepts.

## Basic Concepts

### Variables

In Java, a variable is a container that holds data. There are different types of variables, including primitive types and reference types.

### Data Types

Java supports various data types such as int, float, double, char, boolean, etc. Understanding data types is crucial for variable declaration and manipulation.

### Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

### Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements, such as if, switch, for, while, and do-while, control the flow of execution in a Java program.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects

Classes are the blueprint for objects, and objects are instances of classes. Learn about class and object creation, constructors, and methods.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a key OOP concept that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Explore single and multiple inheritance.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. Learn about method overloading and overriding.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, or class.

### Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling in Java helps manage runtime errors gracefully. Learn about try-catch blocks, throw, throws, and finally.

## Collections Framework

### Lists

Lists are dynamic arrays that store elements in a specific order. Explore ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

### Sets

Sets store unique elements and do not allow duplicates. Learn about HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

### Maps

Maps store key-value pairs. Explore HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

### Iterators

Iterators provide a way to traverse through collections. Learn about Iterator and ListIterator.

## Multithreading

### Thread Creation

Creating threads allows concurrent execution of tasks. Learn about extending the Thread class and implementing the Runnable interface.

### Synchronization

Synchronization ensures that only one thread accesses shared resources at a time. Learn about synchronized methods and blocks.

### Concurrency

Concurrency involves executing multiple threads simultaneously. Learn about Executor framework and Callable.

## File I/O

### Reading and Writing Files

File I/O operations include reading from and writing to files. Learn about FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.

### Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting objects into a byte stream. Learn about Serializable interface and ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream.

## Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

### Connecting to a Database

Connecting to a database involves establishing a connection using DriverManager and Connection.

### Executing SQL Queries

Executing SQL queries involves creating statements, result sets, and handling transactions.

## Java Standard Edition (SE) APIs

### java.util Package

The java.util package provides utility classes and data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, and Date.

### java.lang Package

The java.lang package contains fundamental classes and provides support for threads, strings, exceptions, and more.

### java.io Package

The java.io package provides classes for reading and writing to files, streams, and serialization.

## Advanced Topics

### Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions enable functional programming in Java. Learn about the syntax and usage of lambdas.

### Streams API

The Streams API facilitates functional-style operations on streams of elements. Learn about map, filter, reduce, and collect operations.

### JavaFX

JavaFX is a platform for creating desktop applications. Learn about building graphical user interfaces (GUI) using JavaFX.

### Java 9+ Features

Explore new features introduced in Java 9 and later versions, including module system, private methods in interfaces, and more.

## Best Practices

Adopting best practices ensures clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Learn about naming conventions, code organization, and design principles.

## Sample Programs

Explore a collection of sample programs covering various Core Java concepts. These programs serve as practical examples to reinforce your understanding.
